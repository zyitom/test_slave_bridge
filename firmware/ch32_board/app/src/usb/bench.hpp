// USB SuperSpeed bulk benchmark mode -- measures what the EP1 pipe can do with
// every application-layer cost removed, so a disappointing forwarding number can
// be attributed to the right layer.
//
// Enabled only by -DLIBRMCS_CH32_USB_BENCH=1 (see CMakeLists.txt). With the flag
// off this header expands to nothing and the production firmware is byte-for-byte
// unaffected, which is the point: the bench deliberately breaks the protocol
// (no deserializer, no session, no framing) and must never ship enabled.
//
// WHY A FIRMWARE MODE IS NEEDED AT ALL
//   uplink   there is no data source. With no peripherals attached the
//            serializer stays empty, so the host can never measure EP1 IN.
//   downlink every packet is fed to the deserializer, which scans it byte by
//            byte. At 5 Gbit/s that hits the CPU long before it hits the pipe,
//            so the number would describe the parser, not the link.
//
// The bench also raises the burst count: production tx_write() always arms
// EXP_NUMP = 1 because a protocol batch is capped at 1023 bytes, while the
// endpoint companion descriptor advertises bMaxBurst 15. The bench arms full
// 16 x 1024 byte bursts, which is what the hardware is actually rated for.
