// Debugger-writable knobs and read-only mirrors, for bringing a peripheral up
// against real hardware without a host, a protocol change or a rebuild between
// each attempt. Ozone's Watched Data window updates and accepts writes while the
// program runs (Cortex-M7 background memory access), so these turn a debug
// session into a control panel: type a frequency, hear it.
//
// Why mirrors rather than watching the objects directly. The raw samples are
// already watchable at librmcs::firmware::adc::mc02_samples, but reading a
// battery voltage from them means averaging sixteen half-words and applying the
// divider by hand on every glance. millivolts() cannot be watched instead --
// Ozone evaluates symbol expressions, it does not call target functions, so the
// only way to see a computed value is for the target to compute it into a
// variable. That is what battery_mv is.
//
// Why writing tone_hz beats poking TIM12->ARR from the debugger, which needs no
// firmware support at all: writing the register tests the transducer and
// nothing else, while writing a frequency here goes through the same
// Buzzer::set_tone() the application uses, so the reload arithmetic and the
// duty-cycle mapping are under test too.
//
// Compiled out entirely by default. Cost when enabled is one HAL_GetTick() read
// and a compare per main-loop pass; the work below runs at kPollIntervalMs.
// That bound is deliberate -- this board's downlink packet rate is a strong,
// non-monotonic function of the main-loop period (see firmware/mc02/AGENTS.md),
// so unconditional per-pass work would move throughput benchmarks by more than
// the effect most of them are trying to measure.
