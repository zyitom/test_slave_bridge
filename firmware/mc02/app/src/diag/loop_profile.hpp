// Where the main loop's time actually goes, measured rather than argued about.
//
// The question this exists to settle: past roughly 780 KB/s of aggregate UART
// forwarding the board starts losing data, and delivered throughput *falls* as
// offered load rises -- congestion collapse, not link saturation. Turning the
// IMU on costs another 18.5% at that point, which proves the CPU is the
// constraint there (a CPU waiting on a saturated USB link would have absorbed
// that extra work for free). What it does not say is which part of the loop is
// expensive: "main loop work" is a category, not a function.
//
// Instrumentation is one DWT->CYCCNT read per section boundary, attributing the
// delta to the section just left. DWT is a free-running 32-bit cycle counter at
// 550 MHz already enabled in app.cpp and until now never read by anything.
// Twelve boundaries per pass at roughly 5 cycles each is about 4% of a 2.6 us
// pass -- enough to shift the absolute numbers slightly, not enough to reorder
// them, which is what this is for. Compiled out entirely by default.
