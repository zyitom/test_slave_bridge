// Passive-buzzer driver on a timer PWM channel.
//
// The file has two halves and they are meant to be separated:
//
//   1. Everything up to "mc02 binding" is board-agnostic. It names no handle,
//      no pin and no clock of this board -- the timer, the channel and the
//      counter rate all arrive as constructor arguments. Copying this half into
//      another STM32 project needs no edits.
//   2. The binding at the bottom is the only mc02-specific part: which timer,
//      which channel, what the counter ticks at. Another board rewrites those
//      three values and nothing else.
//
// Construction is inert on purpose -- it touches no register. Nothing sounds,
// and no timer channel is enabled, until someone calls start(). A project that
// only wants the driver present can construct it and never start it; a project
// that has not run its MX_TIMx_Init() yet must not start it. Same discipline as
// power.hpp, for the same reason: what the hardware does at power-on should be
// the board's decision, not a side effect of a constructor running.
