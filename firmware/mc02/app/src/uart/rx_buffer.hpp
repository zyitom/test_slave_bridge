namespace librmcs::firmware::uart {

// Continuous DMA reception into a power-of-two ring.
//
// One circular DMA transfer spans the whole ring and is never stopped or
// re-armed: USART_CR3_DMAR stays set for the entire life of the port and the
// stream wraps by itself. That is the whole point of this class. The previous
// mc02 implementation used HAL_UARTEx_ReceiveToIdle_DMA with a one-shot
// (DMA_NORMAL) stream, and this HAL clears DMAR and aborts the stream *before*
// invoking the RX event callback -- see UART_DMAReceiveCplt() and the IDLE
// branch of HAL_UART_IRQHandler in
// bsp/stm32h7xx-hal-driver/Src/stm32h7xx_hal_uart.c. Reception was therefore off
// from that abort until the application re-armed it, and because the one-shot
// buffer was 64 bytes, any stream longer than 64 bytes hit that window once per
// 64 bytes and lost whatever arrived inside it.
//
// The write position is not maintained by an interrupt. NDTR counts down across
// the ring and reloads on wrap, so the consumer derives the position from it
// directly in try_dequeue(). c_board instead runs the stream double-buffered
// over 32-byte banks and takes an interrupt per bank to re-point the idle bank
// and publish the position -- an interrupt per 32 bytes whose only product is a
// number the consumer could have read for itself. Deriving it here has three
// consequences beyond deleting the bookkeeping:
//
//   - the deadline for servicing the stream widens from one bank (32 byte times)
//     to a full lap of the ring (kBufferSize byte times), because no bank
//     address has to be advanced before the hardware reaches it;
//   - the RX interrupt rate drops to the idle-event rate, from roughly 9000/s
//     per port at 921600 baud;
//   - the only place where a UART interrupt masked the FDCAN interrupt goes
//     away. The bank bookkeeping read and wrote several stream registers, so it
//     ran under a global __disable_irq(); FDCAN sits at NVIC priority 1 and its
//     forwarding path is the one this board spends .itcm/.dtcm on.
//
// Reception errors are absorbed rather than recovered from. STM32H7 can leave the
// DMA request unblocked across a line error (CR3.DDRE clear) and can stop raising
// overruns altogether (CR3.OVRDIS); see configure_rx_error_policy(), and read the
// polarity note there before touching either bit. STM32F407 has neither, so
// c_board is forced to tear the stream down and restart it every time a glitch
// arrives. Restarting is still implemented here for genuine DMA controller
// faults, and the restart path uses two more registers c_board does not have:
// ICR to drop sticky flags without a destructive RDR read, and RQR.RXFRQ to
// empty the 16-entry RXFIFO.
//
// The consumer runs in the main loop (try_dequeue), so the interrupt path only
// bumps a counter and never touches USB.
