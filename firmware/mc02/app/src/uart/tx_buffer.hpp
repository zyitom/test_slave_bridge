// Ring-buffered DMA transmission with idle-boundary preservation, ported from
// c_board.
//
// Two properties matter versus the double-buffer scheme this replaces on mc02.
// The ring is 2048 bytes instead of 128, so a burst of downlink packets no longer
// overflows after two protocol frames. And a packet flagged idle_delimited gets a
// checkpoint recorded at its boundary; try_dequeue refuses to transmit across
// that checkpoint until the line has been idle for 300 us, which is what keeps
// packet framing intact for devices that delimit on idle. The old path simply
// concatenated whatever had accumulated into a single DMA burst and dropped the
// flag on the floor.
//
// half_duplex is the single thing that varies between a port that owns its
// transmit line and one sharing two wires with every other node on a bus. It is
// a bare bool rather than a policy type because on this board there is exactly
// one such distinction and it is inherent to RS-485: the only half-duplex ports
// are the two RS-485 transceivers, and no third duplex mode is possible. Every
// branch it guards sits behind `if constexpr`, so TxBuffer<false> compiles to
// exactly what this class was before the parameter existed -- no extra test, no
// extra load, no extra storage, and try_dequeue() keeps its zero-argument form.
// The three sizes default to what a streaming port wants. A port carrying short
// request/response transactions needs a fraction of it, and on this board every
// byte is charged against a 32 KB region -- see the values chosen for the two
// RS-485 ports at the bottom of uart.hpp.
//
// staging_size deserves attention when tuning them: try_dequeue() clamps every
// chunk to it, so a packet longer than staging_size leaves in two DMA bursts
// with a main-loop gap between them. On a stream that is invisible, but on a
// half-duplex bus it puts silence in the middle of a frame and the peer's
// framing breaks. Keeping staging_size equal to buffer_size makes that
// impossible, since a packet that fits the ring then always fits one burst.
