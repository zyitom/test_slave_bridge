// Battery / rail voltage from a resistor divider on an ADC channel, sampled by
// circular DMA so no code has to wait on a conversion.
//
// Two halves, same split as buzzer.hpp and key.hpp: the class below names no
// handle or pin of this board; the binding at the bottom does.
//
// Four .ioc settings this driver depends on. If a Generate moves any back, it
// reads zeros or garbage rather than failing, so check here first:
//
//   1. ConversionDataManagement = ADC_CONVERSIONDATA_DMA_CIRCULAR. The CubeMX
//      default (..._DR) raises no DMA request at all: the stream arms and waits
//      forever, silently.
//   2. SamplingTime = ADC_SAMPLETIME_64CYCLES_5. See
//      kMinRecommendedSamplingTime.
//   3. ClockPrescaler = ADC_CLOCK_ASYNC_DIV128: PLL2P 120 MHz -> 937.5 kHz.
//      Deliberately slow. DS13313 Table 80 caps fADC per CR.BOOST at
//      6.25/12.5/25/50 MHz, but ADC_ConfigureBoostMode() halves fADC before
//      bucketing against those same numbers ("divider by 2 for Rev.V"), so
//      above 6.25 MHz it always programs one bucket low and no prescaler fixes
//      that. Under-boosting costs SAR comparator bias current: at 16 bits, a
//      plausible wrong number, never an error. Both reference implementations
//      stay in the same band -- the official CtrBoard-H7_ADC example runs
//      1.5 MHz, the vendor BSP 187.5 kHz.
//      A conversion is 64.5 + 8.5 = 73 cycles ~= 78 us, so a 16-entry buffer
//      refills every 1.25 ms.
//   4. DMA2_Stream5 at NVIC preemption priority 5. Everything else here is more
//      urgent: FDCAN 1, USB 2, DMA and UART 3, SPI and EXTI 4. CubeMX defaults
//      this to 0, above CAN receive.
//   5. RCC_PERIPHCLK_ADC in PeriphCommonClock_Config, sourced from PLL2P. Lose
//      it and the ADC has no kernel clock at all: calibration never completes
//      and start() below has to check the clock before it will wait on one.
