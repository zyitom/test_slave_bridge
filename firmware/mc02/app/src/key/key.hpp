// pin of this board and can be copied into another STM32 project unedited; the
// binding at the bottom is the only part that knows about PA15.
//
// Construction is inert and start() only latches the current level -- it
// configures no pin, because a push-button input is exactly the kind of thing
// MX_GPIO_Init() has already set up from the .ioc, and re-doing it here would be
// a second source of truth for the pull direction.
//
// Nothing in the mc02 app calls this yet. It is written and left unstarted on
// purpose: the driver is the reusable part, deciding what a long press should do
// is the board's business.
