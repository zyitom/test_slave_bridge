// Step 1 of the USB-SOF cross-board time base: prove that FRINDEX really does
// advance by exactly one per SOF interrupt, before any of the timeline algorithm
// is written.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AS ITS OWN FIRMWARE STEP. The whole scheme rests on the device
// controller's frame index being a passive, hardware-updated copy of the host's
// microframe counter -- identical on every board hanging off the same host
// controller, because every board is clocked by the same SOF edges. If the
// controller instead sets the SOF-received status flag slightly BEFORE it
// increments FRINDEX, an interrupt handler that reads the register at entry sees
// the previous value, and the observed delta sequence degenerates into an
// alternating 0, 2, 0, 2 pattern. Both cases produce a working-looking counter,
// and they differ by exactly one microframe of systematic offset -- which is 125
// us, two orders of magnitude past the ~1 us the design targets. Debugging that
// after the wrap-count state machine and the host protocol exist would mean
// separating an algorithm bug from a silicon race with both in flight, so it is
// answered here with nothing else running.
//
// The record therefore carries three independent discriminators:
//   * a full histogram of consecutive FRINDEX deltas (the primary evidence);
//   * for every anomalous delta, the USBSTS the interrupt was taken on, PORTSC1
//     (port speed, suspend, PHY low-power), and the millisecond tick -- enough
//     to tell an enumeration artifact from something happening in steady state;
//   * a second FRINDEX read taken immediately after the first, inside the same
//     interrupt -- a nonzero "advanced within ISR" count is the direct signature
//     of sampling right on the increment edge;
//   * ISR-to-ISR local timer intervals, which must center on 125 us. A delta of
//     1 paired with a 250 us interval means interrupts are being missed and the
//     counter is silently wrong, which the delta histogram alone cannot see.
//
// The register reads and the SRI acknowledge live in sync/sof.cpp, which is the
// single SOF hook this and sync::timebase share; the probe only receives the
// values.
//
// Compiled out entirely unless LIBRMCS_APP_SOF_DIAG, so a production image
// carries neither the counters nor the 8 kHz interrupt.
