// Shared cross-board time base, built on the USB microframe counter.
//
// WHAT IT IS. Every board on one USB host controller sees the same SOF packets,
// so FRINDEX is the same number on all of them at the same instant -- a clock
// distributed by hardware, with no software path to add skew. This module turns
// that into a usable timeline: a 64-bit microframe counter, a sliding-window fit
// against the local machine timer so any local instant can be named in
// microframes and any microframe can be named in local ticks, and a state
// machine that refuses to answer at all when the counter cannot be trusted.
//
// WHY THE HOST TIMESTAMP CANNOT DEGRADE IT. The counter's low 14 bits are
// FRINDEX itself -- hardware-exact and identical on every board. The host's
// anchor message supplies only the WRAP: which multiple of 16384 those bits
// belong to. So the anchor is quantized to 2.048 s and its error has to exceed
// +-1.024 s before it changes anything at all. Two boards given the same anchor
// therefore compute a bit-identical absolute microframe even if that anchor is
// wildly wrong -- absolute correctness needs an accurate host, but CROSS-BOARD
// agreement does not depend on the host clock in any way. That is the whole
// point of the split, and it is why the anchor must be computed ONCE per round
// on the host and sent unchanged to every board.
//
// WHAT INVALIDATES IT. Any microframe delta that is not 1. A delta of 2..7 is a
// few missed interrupts: the counter can still be corrected (it advances by the
// real delta) but the fit window is discarded, because those samples would drag
// the line. A delta of 0, or 8 and above, means the counter itself is in doubt
// -- the timeline goes invalid and nothing may be scheduled against it until a
// fresh anchor arrives. On the validated hardware neither branch fires in steady
// state (SOF_TIMEBASE.md), but they are the safety net, not dead code to delete.
//
// Compiled out unless LIBRMCS_APP_TIME_SYNC. Enabling it adds an 8 kHz
// interrupt to the board, which is why it is not on by default.
