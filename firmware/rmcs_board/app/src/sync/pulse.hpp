// Direct cross-board skew measurement over the existing UART0 wires, using
// GPTMR hardware compare and capture -- no CPU in either the send or the
// receive instant.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Every earlier attempt measured the timeline through the CAN
// timestamp unit, whose timebase is PTPC. PTPC hangs off PLL0, which the
// HPM5300 datasheet describes as fractional-N with spread-spectrum support, and
// its instantaneous rate wanders by hundreds of ppm. That wander -- not the
// timeline, and not the boards -- is what produced every bogus figure from
// 452 us down to 30 us.
//
// GPTMR is in CLK_SRC_GROUP_COMMON, so it can be clocked straight from the
// 24 MHz crystal, the same source the machine timer divides by 6. No PLL, no
// fractional divider, no spread spectrum: the rate is as steady as the crystal.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT: an exact 3000 ticks per microframe. The microframe axis is the
// USB HOST's clock (SOF), the GPTMR counter is THIS BOARD's crystal, and the two
// are independent oscillators -- measured about +80 ppm apart, i.e. ~3000.25
// ticks per microframe. Assuming 3000 puts 4 us of error into a 50 ms lead, so
// the ratio is FITTED here, exactly as timebase.cpp fits the machine timer.
// (An earlier revision of this file assumed the exact 3000 on the grounds that
// "both come from the crystal". Only one of them does.)
//
// WIRING: none to add. UART0 already crosses between the two boards
// (A.TXD<->B.RXD both ways), and those pins carry GPTMR0 channel 1's compare
// output and capture input as ALT1:
//
//   PB08  UART0 TXD  /  GPTMR0_COMP_1   -- pulse out
//   PB09  UART0 RXD  /  GPTMR0_CAPT_1   -- pulse in
//
// So the existing cable becomes a bidirectional hardware timing link. UART0 is
// unavailable while this is enabled, which is why it is its own build option.
//
// MEASUREMENT. Each board fires a pulse at an agreed microframe and captures
// the other's. Board A's pulse leaves at microframe a_tx and is captured at
// b_rx; board B's leaves at b_tx and is captured at a_rx. Then
//
//     skew = ((b_rx - a_tx) - (a_rx - b_tx)) / 2
//
// Cable propagation and the pad/synchroniser delay appear with the same sign in
// both directions and cancel in the difference -- the standard two-way
// exchange. What survives is the difference between the two boards' own ideas of
// when microframe k happens, which is exactly what an action scheduled on the
// shared axis would inherit.
//
// Resolution is one GPTMR tick, 41.7 ns. That is coarse against the ~42 ns the
// timeline is expected to achieve, but it is coarse in a harmless way: the
// quantisation is zero-mean and dithered by the real jitter, so over a thousand
// exchanges the MEAN converges to well under a nanosecond, and the SPREAD only
// grows by the quadrature term (42 -> 44 ns), which can be subtracted out.
