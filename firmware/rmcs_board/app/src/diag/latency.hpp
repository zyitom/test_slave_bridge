// Board-side latency breakdown, readable over EP0 on the shipping image.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. A CAN round trip on this link measures around 118 us, and
// until now there was no way to say how much of that the board is responsible
// for. The only instrument was a LIBRMCS_CAN_DIAG build, whose telemetry rides
// DataId::kUart0 and therefore corrupts anything measuring that channel -- on
// 2026-09-04 that cost six reflashes and one false UART regression. Without the
// split, every latency decision is a guess about which segment to attack.
//
// Two segments are timed, both entirely inside the board:
//
//   downlink  the bulk OUT completion callback is entered, until the CAN frame
//             is in the controller's TX FIFO. Covers deserialization, dispatch
//             and the MCAN write.
//   uplink    the CAN receive interrupt is entered, until the frame has been
//             serialized into the uplink batch. Covers the FIFO read,
//             normalization and serialization.
//
// What is deliberately NOT covered: the wire time of the CAN frame itself
// (about 50 us for 8 bytes at 1M/5M FD), the USB microframe quantization, and
// the host's own submit/wakeup path. Those are the other terms of the 118 us,
// and the point of this header is to size the board's share against them.
//
// CSR_MCYCLE is the clock source: one instruction, core-clock resolution, and
// no side effects -- unlike reading a peripheral register, it cannot perturb
// what it measures. That property is why can_diag uses it too, and it matters
// here because both call sites are on the hot path.
