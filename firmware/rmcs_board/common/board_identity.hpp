// Which physical PCB this chip is soldered to, read at run time out of the
// factory-programmed OTP shadow rather than baked in at compile time.
//
// OPT-IN, PER BOARD
//
// Only the hpm5321 board enables this, by defining LIBRMCS_BOARD_OTP_IDENTITY=1
// in its CMakeLists.txt, because it is the only board whose directory serves two
// electrically different PCBs. Every other board keeps a single-variant identity
// that is recognized unconditionally and reports its compile-time PID, so the
// shared bootloader and app code below can be written without #if at the call
// sites.
//
// This gate is not cosmetic. The refusal path keys on two specific values of word
// 25, and those values are hpm5321 observations: boards/hpm6e8y/README.md records
// word 25 = 0x00000006 on that part. An ungated check would therefore classify
// every hpm6e8y and hpm6e80ivm1 as unrecognized and refuse to boot hardware that
// has nothing to do with the ambiguity this solves.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// The two HPM5321 PCBs in this project are electrically incompatible on two
// pads: PA30/PA31 are the green/red LED cathodes on the single-CAN board and
// MCAN3 RXD/TXD on the dual-CAN-FD board. A single firmware image therefore
// cannot configure those pads until it knows which board it is on, and getting
// it wrong in the dual->single direction drives a transceiver output against an
// LED network. So the image has to ask the hardware, and it has to refuse to
// guess.
//
// WHAT THE EVIDENCE ACTUALLY SUPPORTS  [实测 2026-08-05, 4 chips]
//
// OTP shadow word 25 reads 0 on both single-CAN boards sampled and 2 on both
// dual-CAN-FD boards sampled. Everything else that differs between the four
// dumps (word 5 lot number, word 21 TSNS trim, words 88-91 UUID) is per-die.
//
// This is NOT proof that word 25 encodes the board type. The four samples are
// batch-ordered -- lots 375/377 are the dual boards, 378/380 the single ones --
// so "board variant" and "production batch" are perfectly confounded in the
// sample, and word 25 is undefined in the SDK's hpm_otp_table.h (the HPM6E8Y
// board notes call the same word a program-count/config flag). Distinguishing
// the two would need a counterexample from an interleaved batch: a single board
// from lot 375-377, or a dual board from lot >=378.
//
// The strictness below is what makes that acceptable: only the two observed
// values are ever accepted, and anything else stops the boot instead of picking
// a default. A batch artifact would then show up as a refusal to run, which is
// loud and inspectable, rather than as a misconfigured pad.
//
// COST AND SAFETY OF THE READ
//
// One MMIO load per boot. otp_read_from_shadow() bounds-checks the index and
// reads HPM_OTP->SHADOW[index]; otp_init()/otp_deinit() are empty in the SDK,
// there is no clock gate and no command sequence on the read path. Programming
// OTP is an entirely separate mechanism (2.5 V LDO enable, the UNLOCK magic, and
// writes to FUSE[]), none of which this touches -- so reads cannot wear or
// damage the array. Both halves of this firmware already read four OTP shadow
// words on every boot for the UUID-derived USB serial number; this adds a fifth.
