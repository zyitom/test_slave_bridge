// Cross-image contract for the FoE staging region.
//
// WHO WRITES WHAT, and why it is split this way:
//
//   * The RUNNING APP receives a firmware image (over FoE in BOOT state, or over
//     USB on the self-test path) and writes it into the staging region. It can
//     never write the app slot directly: core0 executes from that slot over XIP,
//     so the erase would remove the code performing it. On the EtherCAT build the
//     bytes arrive on core1 and cross to core0 through the MBX1 flash RPC, which
//     is the only path on this part that may touch the NOR.
//
//   * The BOOTLOADER installs. After a cold reset it finds a Ready record here,
//     re-validates the staged image, and copies it into the app slot -- which it
//     may do safely because the bootloader lives in its own 124 KiB below the app
//     and never executes from the region it is erasing.
//
// CRASH SAFETY. The record is committed by programming `state` LAST, so every
// interruption lands on a state that is either "ignore" or "redo":
//
//   power loss while writing the image      -> state never set  -> ignored
//   power loss between `image_size`/`state` -> state never set  -> ignored
//   power loss after commit, before install -> Ready            -> installed next boot
//   power loss DURING install               -> still Ready      -> reinstalled next boot
//
// The staging record is cleared only after the app metadata has committed, which
// is what makes the last line hold. Do not reorder that.
//
// Unlike the app metadata sector this is a single fixed record rather than an
// append-only slot array: a staging session always rewrites the whole region, so
// there is nothing to append and one sector erase per session is already paid
// for by the image erase that follows it.
