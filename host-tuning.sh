# Host-side latency tuning for the librmcs transports (USB bulk and EtherCAT/IgH).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: every setting below is runtime-only and reverts on reboot, and
# the machine's own facts (which xHCI controller the board landed on, which IRQ
# serves it, whether the isolated core is a P-core or an E-core) change without
# anyone editing a doc. So this script DISCOVERS rather than hardcodes, and
# reports what it found even when it changes nothing.
#
# WHAT IS MEASURED AND WHAT IS NOT -- read before believing any of it.
# Host-path numbers below come from host/examples/usb_ep0_rtt.cpp (3000 samples,
# 1 ms gap, SCHED_FIFO 80, pinned); board+USB RTT numbers come from
# can_loopback_latency. Full write-up and the negative results in HOST_TUNING.md.
#
#   CPU frequency       MEASURED, LARGEST SINGLE EFFECT. p50 77.5 -> 67.5 us,
#                       p99 ~100 -> ~82 us, reproduced over 3 rounds. A
#                       SCHED_FIFO thread that SLEEPS between transfers does NOT
#                       hold the clock up: under powersave the core sat at
#                       1.8-2.3 GHz and only reached 4.1 GHz once something
#                       stopped it from idling. This supersedes the older
#                       "governor: measured, no effect" note -- see HOST_TUNING.md
#                       section 4 for why the CAN-loopback test could not see it.
#   PM QoS / C-states   MEASURED, AND IT IS THE SAME EFFECT AS THE GOVERNOR, NOT
#                       AN ADDITIONAL ONE. pm_qos=0 gives p50 68.3; governor
#                       alone gives 67.5; BOTH TOGETHER give 68.3 -- not additive,
#                       because both simply keep the core clocked up. Holding
#                       /dev/cpu_dma_latency at 0 costs power machine-wide, so
#                       prefer the governor and add --pmqos only for the last
#                       ~2 us at p99. NOT applied by this script: it needs a
#                       process to hold the fd open (see --pmqos).
#   Per-core C-state    MEASURED, DOES NOT WORK. Disabling C6/C10 on the
#     disable           application core alone changed nothing (p50 77.8 vs 77.4
#                       baseline). Disabling them on ALL cores while leaving C1E
#                       enabled bought only a small tail improvement (p99 ~94 vs
#                       ~100) and NO p50 change -- C1E alone is enough to let the
#                       clock fall. Do not replace --pmqos with this.
#   cpuidle governor    MEASURED, NO EFFECT. menu -> teo moved nothing outside
#     menu -> teo       noise. Reported below, not changed.
#   Bluetooth on the    MEASURED, NO EFFECT on the host path. btusb shares the
#     board's root hub  board's root hub and does inject periodic split
#                       transactions, but unbinding it moved nothing. Reported
#                       below so the neighbour is at least visible.
#   RT throttling off   Assumed necessary, inherited from earlier work (a ~50 ms
#                       max latency was traced to it). NOT re-measured here.
#   xHCI IRQ thread     MEASURED, NO EFFECT WITH ONE BOARD; REQUIRED WITH TWO.
#     RT priority       See HOST_TUNING.md 4.3: two boards on one controller share
#                       one IRQ thread, and at the RT default of FIFO 50 both
#                       boards' max latency goes to ~1 ms. This script prints the
#                       discovered IRQ and its priority; it does not raise it,
#                       because for the single-board case that is a no-op.
#   USB power/control   Set to on. NOT measured as a delta -- runtime_status was
#                       already 'active', so nothing was ever suspending. Applied
#                       to close off a class of surprise.
#   irqbalance          Must stay OFF (it would migrate the xHCI IRQ at runtime).
#
# EXPLICITLY DISPROVEN -- do NOT add these back:
#   Pinning the xHCI IRQ to the same core as the libusb event thread:
#   p50 124.8 -> 146.2 us, p90 126 -> 157 us. The ISR and the event thread
#   serialize on one core; that costs far more than the cross-core wakeup saves.
#   Leave the xHCI IRQ and the event thread on DIFFERENT cores.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./host-tuning.sh              apply everything except PM QoS, then report
#   sudo ./host-tuning.sh --check      report only, change nothing
#   sudo ./host-tuning.sh --pmqos      hold C-states off in the foreground
#                                      (Ctrl-C to release; run in a second
