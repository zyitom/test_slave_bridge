# Flash the c_board application over USB DFU.
#
# Prerequisite: the c_board DFU bootloader is already on the board (flashed once
# via SWD/J-Link, see README). Put the device into DFU mode first:
#   - power up with no valid app in flash (bootloader stays in DFU), or
#   - trigger a DFU reboot from the host while the app runs.
# A running app also exposes the DFU runtime interface, so dfu-util will detach
# and re-enumerate it into DFU mode automatically.
#
# Usage:
#   ./flash-cboard.sh                 # builds the release preset, then flashes
#   PRESET=debug ./flash-cboard.sh    # build/flash a debuggable (-O0) image instead
#
