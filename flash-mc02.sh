# Flash the mc02 application over USB DFU.
#
# Prerequisite: the mc02 DFU bootloader is already on the board (flashed once via
# SWD/J-Link, see README "烧录 Bootloader"). Put the device into DFU mode first:
#   - power up with no valid app in flash (bootloader stays in DFU), or
#   - trigger a DFU reboot from the host while the app runs.
# A running app also exposes the DFU runtime interface, so dfu-util will detach
# and re-enumerate it into DFU mode automatically.
#
# Usage:
#   ./flash-mc02.sh                 # builds the release preset, then flashes
#   PRESET=debug ./flash-mc02.sh    # build/flash a debuggable (-O0) image instead
#   SKIP_BOOTLOADER=1 ./flash-mc02.sh   # app only, do not touch the bootloader target
#
