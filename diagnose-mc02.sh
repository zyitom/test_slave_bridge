# Read-only check of why the mc02 bootloader is not jumping to the application.
#
# Nothing is erased, programmed or reset -- the probe attaches to the running
# target and reads memory, so the board's state is exactly what it was.
#
# It reports the state of the two gates in bootloader/src/main.cpp that stand
# between a valid image and jump_to_app():
#
#   1. the metadata record in flash sector 1, which validate_app_image() needs
#      to read as "ready" (magic "RMCS" + state "IMRD" + image size), and
#   2. the KEY pin, whose force_stay overrides even a fresh APP1 boot request.
#
# KEY is PA15, which is also JTDI. A probe that drives TDI reads as a held key
# and pins the board in DFU forever, so run this with the probe attached to see
# the value the bootloader actually samples.
#
# Usage:
#   ./diagnose-mc02.sh
