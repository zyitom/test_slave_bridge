// EP0 (control endpoint) configuration channel.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Channel configuration used to ride the same bulk byte stream
// as the data itself: a UART baudrate went out as a kUart*Config field, and the
// CAN frame type as a per-frame IsFdCan header bit. Both were write-only. The
// deserializer callback's bool means "this field id was recognized", not "the
// operation succeeded", so a baudrate the board's divisor solver could not
// represent was rejected on the board and reported to the host as success --
// the failure mode that makes a peer rate mismatch look like a wiring fault.
// (firmware/rmcs_board/AGENTS.md recorded this as an open gap: "configuration
// rejected, the host cannot see it".) Echoing the field back does not work
// either: config is a downlink-only channel by contract and an uplink one fails
// the host deserializer outright.
//
// A control transfer has the acknowledgement the bulk stream lacks: the device
// stalls the status stage to reject, and every setting can be read back. So
// configuration moves here, is applied ONCE while the host board object is
// being constructed, and is verified by reading back what the hardware is
// actually running before the constructor returns.
//
// Not gated on the session handshake. Configuration is transport state, not
// data-plane state -- the host applies it before the first keepalive has opened
// a session, and a board must answer these while its data plane is idle.

// Which pipe the board sends CAN uplink on.
//
// The second bulk pipe is not free: the host has to post idle IN URBs on it,
// and those are polled and NAKed continuously, taking scheduling slots from the
// data pipe. Measured on hpm5321: 49466 packets/s with the pipe, 63333 without
// -- 28%, against a per-device ceiling of about 64000.
//
// Whether that is worth paying depends on the load, and it is a genuine
// crossover rather than a strict win: the second pipe keeps a CAN frame from
// queueing behind a UART batch, worth about 21 us of p99 at UART line rate, but
// costs about 11 us of p99 when UART is idle (firmware/rmcs_board/AGENTS.md).
// So it is a runtime choice, not a build-time one.
//
// BOTH SIDES MUST AGREE. A host that stops listening on the second pipe while
// the board still transmits there loses every CAN frame, silently -- measured,
// 8000 of 8000 round trips timed out. This request is what keeps them in step.
// How much of a CAN round trip the board is responsible for.
//
// Two segments, both entirely inside the board and both measured in core clock
// cycles (divide by cpu_hz):
//
//   downlink  bulk OUT completion -> frame in the MCAN TX FIFO
//   uplink    CAN receive interrupt -> frame serialized into the uplink batch
//
// Everything else in the round trip is elsewhere: the CAN wire itself (about
// 50 us for 8 bytes at 1M/5M FD), USB microframe quantization, and the host's
// submit/wakeup path. Sizing the board's share against those is the point --
// without it, choosing which segment to optimise is guesswork.
