# Flash the dual CAN-FD HPM5321 board over USB DFU.
#
# Builds BOARD=hpm5321, whose single image serves both HPM5321 PCBs and picks its
# CAN/LED tables at run time from OTP word 25 (firmware/rmcs_board/common/
# board_identity.hpp). The board still enumerates as 0xa902, so the DFU_ID below
# and any udev rule keyed on it are unchanged by the merge.
#
# The HPM5321 board carries the same "RMCS DFU Bootloader" as mc02/c_board, so the
# app is flashed with dfu-util -- no debugger (J-Link/OpenOCD) needed. A debugger
# is only required to put the DFU bootloader onto a blank chip the first time
# (see flash-dual-bootloader.sh / README).
#
# Prerequisite: the DFU bootloader is already on the board. Put the device into
# DFU mode first:
#   - power up with no valid app (bootloader stays in DFU), or
#   - trigger a DFU reboot from the host while the app runs.
# A running app exposes the DFU runtime interface, so dfu-util will detach and
# re-enumerate it into DFU mode automatically.
#
# Usage:
#   ./flash-dual.sh                        # builds the release preset, then flashes
#   PRESET=debug ./flash-dual.sh           # build/flash a debuggable (-O0) image instead
#   BOARD=hpm5321 ./flash-dual.sh          # explicit equivalent of the default
#
