// Priority-inheriting mutex and its matching condition variable.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The USB transport's free-transfer pools are touched by two
// threads with different scheduling priorities: the libusb event thread, which
// callers are expected to raise (transport.hpp's options.thread_setup exists for
// exactly that), and whatever application thread calls acquire/release. glibc
// gives std::mutex PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE, so a low-priority holder that gets
// preempted inside the critical section blocks the high-priority event thread
// for the whole of the preemption -- classic priority inversion, and the
// critical section's own length has nothing to do with how long it lasts.
//
// PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT makes the kernel boost the holder to the waiter's
// priority for the duration, which bounds the block by the critical section
// instead of by the scheduler. On a PREEMPT_RT kernel that is a real rtmutex.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is insurance, not a measured fix. The equivalent lock in
// the EtherCAT backend (igh.cpp's LockedByteRing) was once suspected of causing
// that path's ~50 ms tail; LATENCY_ROADMAP_V2.md found the actual cause was
// kernel.sched_rt_runtime_us throttling, and the lock -- still a plain mutex --
// now measures max 48.3 us over 2M cycles. So do not expect this to move a
// number that is already clean; it removes an unbounded case, nothing more.
//
// std::condition_variable cannot wait on a non-std::mutex, and
// std::condition_variable_any would put its own internal mutex on the notify
// path -- the very path being protected here. Hence the thin pthread_cond_t
// wrapper rather than a standard-library type.
