// Construction-time channel configuration for the rmcs_board family, over EP0.
//
// The rule these helpers exist to enforce: a constructed board object is a board
// whose configuration is KNOWN, not assumed. Every setting is written and then
// read back from the hardware before the constructor returns, and a disagreement
// throws rather than being logged -- a link running at a baudrate the caller did
// not ask for is indistinguishable, from the caller's side, from a wiring fault.
//
// This replaces two write-only paths. UART baudrate used to be an in-band
// kUart*Config field whose acceptance the board had no way to report, and the
// CAN frame type used to be a per-frame header bit that the board silently
// downgraded on a classic bus. Both are now settled once, here, with an answer.
