// EP0 configuration channel test for the HPM5321 dual-CAN-FD board.
//
// WHAT IT PROVES. Channel configuration used to be write-only: a UART baudrate
// went out as an in-band kUart*Config field whose acceptance the board had no
// way to report, and a CAN frame type was a per-frame header bit that a classic
// bus silently downgraded. Both now ride EP0, where the status stage carries the
// answer. This exercises exactly the outcomes the old path could not express:
//
//   1. The board describes itself      -- GET_INTERFACE agrees with the PCB.
//   2. An accepted rate is applied -- and reads back from the hardware as the
//      rate the DIVISOR produces, which is never exactly the requested one
//      (115200 -> 114942 at 80 MHz). Compare with tolerance, never for equality.
//   3. An UNREPRESENTABLE rate is REJECTED, loudly, and the port keeps running
//      at its previous rate. This is the case that used to look like success.
//   4. A rate inside the solver's 3% tolerance is accepted and reported as the
//      value actually programmed, not the value requested (3000000 -> 3076923).
//   5. A wrong CAN mode expectation throws at construction instead of quietly
//      producing frames of the other type on the wire.
//   6. Construction-time configuration works, and a board object that finished
//      constructing is a board whose configuration is known.
//
// Needs one HPM5321 dual-CAN-FD board (PID 0xa902). No CAN or UART wiring: every
// check is a control transfer plus the board's own read-back. Pass a serial
// filter as argv[1] to pick one of several attached boards.
