// Cross-board skew measured by a HARDWARE pulse exchange over the UART0 wires.
//
// The two boards are already cross-wired A.TXD<->B.RXD both ways, and those two
// pins are GPTMR0 channel 1's compare output and capture input. So the existing
// cable is a bidirectional timing link with no CPU at either end: the pulse
// leaves on a comparator match and arrives on a hardware capture.
//
// WHAT THIS MEASURES, precisely. Both boards are told to fire at the SAME
// absolute microframe of the shared USB-SOF timeline. Each board reports where
// it captured the OTHER board's pulse, on its own axis. With d the one-way path
// delay and s the difference between the two boards' ideas of when microframe k
// happens,
//
//     offset_A (A's report) = d - s        offset_B (B's report) = d + s
//     s = (offset_B - offset_A) / 2        d = (offset_B + offset_A) / 2
//
// so the path delay -- cable, pad, synchroniser, Schmitt trigger -- cancels in
// the difference and appears alone in the sum. Note what s is: not the fit
// residual of section 5.2 of SOF_TIMEBASE.md, but the ACTUATION skew, the thing
// two boards would really differ by when both act "at microframe k".
//
// STAGED, AND THE ORDER MATTERS (SOF_TIMEBASE.md 7.1). Five earlier attempts at
// a direct measurement failed by reading a cross-board number before the
// instrument was known good:
//
//   stage 1  the fitted ticks per microframe, from both boards. It must land
//            near 3000.25 (the board crystal is ~+80 ppm fast against the host's
//            USB clock), and the two boards must agree to a few ppm. A round
//            3000.000 would mean the fit is not running at all.
//   stage 2  one-way offsets. Their SPREAD is this instrument's noise floor;
//            nothing below it can be believed. Their MEAN is the path delay.
//   stage 3  the two-way skew, reported only if stage 2 is clean.
//
// Requires firmware built with -DLIBRMCS_PULSE_TEST=ON (which takes UART0 over)
// and -DLIBRMCS_TIME_SYNC=ON (which supplies the microframe axis).
//
// Run:
//   ./pulse_skew_test [rounds] [lead_microframes]
